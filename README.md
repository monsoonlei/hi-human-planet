I'm not sure if I should begin this comment with # becauase that's how we comment in Python. This isn't Python so I'm just
gonna continue on.
Anyway...
I'm an African.
I hate a lot of the people I've had to deal with, as an African.
Okay maybe not hate...but have condemned to their hell as they have condemned me to mine.

One or two (not necessarily Africans) have helped me discover Truth. And love.

Including the love of tech. Since I enjoy ordering stuff about...I don't see why computers should be exempt from my
odering.

I'm learning Python.
Studying communication science.
